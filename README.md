# Data Structures Projects

Marmara University / CSE2025 - Data Structures (2020)

<b>Project I</b>
<p>In this project, I calculated the total access time according to the frequency of the words in the given input. Then, I constructed a Binary Tree where I put the lowest frequency words deepest. My goal here is to minimize the total access time. Then I calculated the total access time for the second case and compared the results.</p>

<b>Project II</b>
<p>In this project, I used binomial heaps to implement a priority queue for the task of ranking documents. So I get a word from the user as input. I list the given input files from high to low according to the frequency of occurrence of this word in the files. Then, it prints the 5 files in which this word occurs most frequently to the user as output.</p>
